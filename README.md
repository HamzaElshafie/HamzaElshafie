I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master’s in Machine Learning and a background in Computer Science. I’ve worked extensively with deep learning, primarily using PyTorch and TensorFlow, with a focus on computer vision tasks.

Recently, I’ve been diving into performance and optimisation, and have started learning CUDA and Triton. Exploring the lower-level side of AI has been both challenging and rewarding. I’d be glad to collaborate on any related projects or opportunities.
